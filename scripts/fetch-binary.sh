# fetch-binary.sh — the plugin's [[build]] command: provision ./asgotopr without
# requiring a Go toolchain.
#
# Downloads the prebuilt binary attached to the GitHub release matching the
# manifest's version (so an install pinned with --ref gets the binary that
# matches that checkout), and falls back to building from source when there is
# no usable asset (unsupported platform, missing release) or the download
# fails. Exits non-zero only when neither path works, which aborts the plugin
# install.
#
# Set ASGOTOPR_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=1 to skip the download and always compile
# locally (for users who prefer not to run prebuilt binaries):
#   ASGOTOPR_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=1 herdr plugin install asumaran/asgotopr
